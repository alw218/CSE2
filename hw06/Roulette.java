/*
For this program, use a random number generator to simulate a personâ€™s 
betting on 100 spins, but run the simulation 1000 times and collect data on 
the outcome.  For the 1000 repetitions of the 100-spin simulation, compute 
the number of times I lose everything (my number never comes up), compute 
the total winnings (out of total $100,000 bet), and compute the number of times
I walked away with a profit in one session of 100 spins of the wheel.
